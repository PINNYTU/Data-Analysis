# Data Camp Case Study Project - Travel Insurance


This is a case study project to complete DataCamp professional certificate. I took approximately 48 hours to prepare the insights and reports. 
The objective of this case study is to help the CEO of a travel insurance company understand more about their customers. 
I import the data into DBeaver to clean/check/transform the data using PostgresSQL. Then I import it to tableau to compare the distribution between 2 groups of customers.
The analysis is separated into 4 parts 

## 1. Profile/Demographics comparison between non customers and customers.
